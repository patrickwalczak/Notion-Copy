# 🧠 Notion Copy

A feature-rich productivity app inspired by **Notion**, built with **React.js** and **Next.js**.

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a personal initiative to replicate the core functionality of Notion, serving as a playground to explore advanced **React** and **Next.js** concepts. It’s designed to help me deepen my understanding of frontend architecture, component design, and state management while working on a complex, real-world application.

## 🛠️ Goals & Features

- ✅ Build a modular and scalable app architecture.
- 🧪 Experiment with design patterns like `useReducer`, `useContext`, and **Redux**.
- 🔄 Work with **dynamic routing**, **server-side rendering (SSR)**, and **static site generation (SSG)** using **Next.js**.
- 🔐 Implement basic **authentication** and protected routes.
- 🧩 Create reusable, maintainable UI components.
- 📡 Integrate backend features with **Supabase** and **Prisma**.
- 🎯 Focus on clean code, performance optimization, and real-world project structure.

## 💡 Why This Project?

I wanted to take a "ready-to-go" app idea and turn it into a **complex development environment** for learning, testing, and building. This project gives me the space to:

- Practice working with full-stack tools.
- Improve my understanding of frontend best practices.
